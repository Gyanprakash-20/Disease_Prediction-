# Disease_Prediction-
Disease Prediction Machine Learning Model <br>

Overview<br>
This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The model uses three different classifiers:<br>
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)<br>
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)<br>
Random Forest Classifier (RFC)<br>
The final disease prediction is determined by taking the mode of predictions made by these three classifiers.<br>

Dataset<br>
The training and testing datasets contain various symptoms and their corresponding diseases. The columns represent symptoms, and the last column is the target value (prognosis).<br>
Training Dataset: Training.csv<br>
Testing Dataset: Testing.csv<br>
